Package: python-pypng
Architecture: all
Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.5-5~)
Description: Pure Python PNG Reader/Writer (Python 2)
 The PyPNG module implements support for PNG images. It reads and writes PNG
 files with all allowable bit depths (1/2/4/8/16/24/32/48/64 bits per pixel) and
 colour combinations: greyscale (1/2/4/8/16 bit); RGB, RGBA, LA (greyscale with
 alpha) with 8/16 bits per channel; colour mapped images (1/2/4/8 bit).
 Adam7 interlacing is supported for reading and writing. A number of optional
 chunks can be specified (when writing) and understood (when reading): tRNS,
 bKGD, gAMA.
 .
 PyPNG is not a high level toolkit for image processing (like PIL) and does not
 aim at being a replacement or competitor. Its strength lies in fine-grained
 extensive support of PNG features. It can also read and write Netpbm PAM files,
 with a focus on its use as an intermediate format for implementing custom PNG
 processing.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version.
